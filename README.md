# Unity Enemy AI

An enemy AI that uses A* Pathfinding, Behaviour trees to determine wander state, flee state, attack state and healing state. A finite state machine to dermine patrol state, alert state and investigate state. Additionally involves functionality for a decoy object that AI follow rather than player and a danger zone which removes small sections from the locale navmesh upon AI entity death.
